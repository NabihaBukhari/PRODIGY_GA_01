# PRODIGY_GA_01

This is my one of the internship task that I completed for Prodigy infotech under the domain of generative AI this task basically focused on impoprting the gpt-2 model and generating text using it.

The flow of the code includes:

1. Input preprocessing using a tokenizer to convert text into token IDs.
2. The GPT-2 model, hosted on a GPU , processes the tokens.
3. Decoding strategies such as beam search and nucleus sampling are applied to generate 
text.
4. The decoded tokens are transformed back into human-readable text using the tokenizer
